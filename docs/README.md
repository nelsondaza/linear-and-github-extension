new [discussion](https://github.com/nelsondaza/linear-and-github-extension/discussions).

### Building with NodeJS

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open your browser and load the appropriate development build. For example, if you are developing for the Chrome browser, using manifest v3, use: `build/chrome-mv3-dev`.

For further guidance, [visit our Documentation](https://docs.plasmo.com/)

## Making production build

Run the following:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This should create a production bundle for your extension, ready to be zipped and published to the stores or upload to your personal Chrome browser.
