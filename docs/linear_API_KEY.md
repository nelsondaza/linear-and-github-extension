# Linear API KEY

## Why LAGE requires an API KEY

The extension requires Linear's API KEY to authenticate and interact with the Linear API. This allows the extension to
access and manipulate data from the Linear service, such as updating or retrieving issues and tasks, which is
essential for integrating Linear with GitHub.
